                    <p>Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is a U.S. federal statute providing that a foreign government’s public sector acts fall outside the scope of a U.S. court’s jurisdiction.  It applies only when a foreign government is the defendant.</p>

                    <p>Comity The doctrine of comity states that, in some circumstances, nations will recognize and defer to the legislative, executive, or judicial acts (including court decisions) of other countries.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Answer</h3>
                    <p>Comity requires that a U.S. court abstain from exercising jurisdiction over a dispute if a foreign court is in a better position to adjudicate it or if it is more appropriate to apply foreign law than U.S. law. U.S. courts recognize foreign judicial decisions as long as: The foreign court had jurisdiction; The foreign proceedings have been “orderly, fair and not detrimental to the nation’s interests” (Basic v. Fitzroy Engineering, Ltd. 949 F. Supp. 1333 (ND Ill 1996) aff’d 132 F. 3d 36 (7th Cir 1997); and  Recognizing the decision will not violate U.S. laws or U.S. public policy.</p>

                    <p>Tariff and Non-TariffBarriers to Trade A tariff is a tax levied on imported goods.  Tariffs can be calculated as a percentage of the value of the imported goods, on the basis of the number or weight of the imported goods, by the unit, or a combination of these. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="card-back">
                    <h3>Answer</h3>
                    <p>A non-tariff barrier is any type of restriction on imports other than tariffs.  For example, quotas are government-imposed restrictions on the number or value of goods that can be imported; and embargoes are government bans on trade with a particular country.</p>

                    <h3>Answer</h3>
                    <p>The WTO aims to liberalize trade by invoking these principles: Normal Trade Relations (NTR).  Each member must give equal trade privileges and benefits to all member nations in relation to the same imports. National Treatment.  Each member must apply the same standards to imports that are applied to domestic goods. Elimination of trade barriers.  Nontariff barriers are prohibited.</p>

                    <p>Dumping and Subsidies Dumping occurs when products of one country are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than the normal value of the product (GATT Article 6(1)).

                    <h3>Answer</h3>
                    <p>A subsidy is a financial contribution by a government that confers a benefit (Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, section 1.1). A specific subsidy is a subsidy available only to a particular enterprise or industry.  Some specific subsidies are prohibited subsidies, which are automatically illegal, and some are actionable subsidies, which are illegal if the subsidy has an adverse effect on the complaining country.</p>
