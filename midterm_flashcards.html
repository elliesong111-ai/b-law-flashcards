            <div class="front">Sovereignty</div>
            <div class="back">A sovereign state is self-governing and independent, and its authority is internationally recognized. A government has power to command control over the population and over a specific geographic region.
Sovereign states typically have:
Identifiable symbols like flags and a national anthem
Some uniform law
Common currency
Postal system
A defined population</div>

            <div class="front">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA)</div>
            <div class="back">The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is a U.S. federal statute providing that a foreign government’s public sector acts fall outside the scope of a U.S. court’s jurisdiction.  It applies only when a foreign government is the defendant.
Exceptions to the FSIA:
The country waived its immunity.
The country engaged in commercial activity.
The country violated property rights in violation of international law.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

        <div class="inner">
            <div class="front">Comity</div>
            <div class="back">The doctrine of comity states that, in some circumstances, nations will recognize and defer to the legislative, executive, or judicial acts (including court decisions) of other countries.
Comity requires that a U.S. court abstain from exercising jurisdiction over a dispute if a foreign court is in a better position to adjudicate it or if it is more appropriate to apply foreign law than U.S. law.
U.S. courts recognize foreign judicial decisions as long as:
The foreign court had jurisdiction;
The foreign proceedings have been “orderly, fair and not detrimental to the nation’s interests” (Basic v. Fitzroy Engineering, Ltd. 949 F. Supp. 1333 (ND Ill 1996) aff’d 132 F. 3d 36 (7th Cir 1997); and 
Recognizing the decision will not violate U.S. laws or U.S. public policy.</div>

            <div class="front">International Law Background</div>
            <div class="back">Public international law refers to law that applies to the relationships between sovereign nations.  Private international law refers to law that applies to the resolution of disputes between private individuals and/or business entities.
Sources of international law:
International treaties and conventions
Customary international law
General principles of law
Judicial decisions and scholarly teachings by international law experts</div>

    <div class="flashcard">
        <div class="inner">
            <div class="front">Treaties and Conventions</div>
            <div class="back">A treaty is “an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments.”
Treaties can be bilateral or multilateral.
Under U.S. law, the executive branch negotiates treaties.  The U.S. Senate provides advice and consent and ratifies it by two-thirds vote.  It is then signed by the president, at which point it is binding.</div>

            <div class="front">Tariff and Non-TariffBarriers to Trade</div>
            <div class="back">A tariff is a tax levied on imported goods.  Tariffs can be calculated as a percentage of the value of the imported goods, on the basis of the number or weight of the imported goods, by the unit, or a combination of these. 
A non-tariff barrier is any type of restriction on imports other than tariffs.  For example, quotas are government-imposed restrictions on the number or value of goods that can be imported; and embargoes are government bans on trade with a particular country.</div>

    <div class="flashcard">
        <div class="inner">
            <div class="front">World Trade Organization (WTO) Principles</div>
            <div class="back">The WTO is “the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations” (www.wto.org). 
The WTO aims to liberalize trade by invoking these principles:
Normal Trade Relations (NTR).  Each member must give equal trade privileges and benefits to all member nations in relation to the same imports.
National Treatment.  Each member must apply the same standards to imports that are applied to domestic goods.
Elimination of trade barriers.  Nontariff barriers are prohibited.</div>
        </div>

    <div class="flashcard">
        <div class="inner">
            <div class="front">Dumping and Subsidies</div>
            <div class="back">Dumping occurs when products of one country are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than the normal value of the product (GATT Article 6(1)).  The normal value of the product is the price charged for that product in the exporter’s home market.
A subsidy is a financial contribution by a government that confers a benefit (Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, section 1.1).
A specific subsidy is a subsidy available only to a particular enterprise or industry.  Some specific subsidies are prohibited subsidies, which are automatically illegal, and some are actionable subsidies, which are illegal if the subsidy has an adverse effect on the complaining country.</div>

            <div class="front">United Nations (UN)</div>
            <div class="back">The UN preamble states that its founders wanted “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,” and the charter authorizes “collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace.”
The UN is comprised of five active bodies:  the General Assembly, Security Council, Secretariat, International Court of Justice, and Economic and Social Council.</div>
